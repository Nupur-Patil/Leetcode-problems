# My LeetCode Journey: A Daily Log
This repository documents my daily practice on LeetCode. Each folder represents a day of problem-solving, starting with easier problems and progressing to more challenging ones. This log serves as a record of my learning and growth in algorithms and data structures.

üìÇ Repository Structure
Each directory is a daily log, containing a single Jupyter notebook with 2-4 problems. The folder name indicates the date to show my progress chronologically.

Day-1/: My first day of practice. Contains solutions for a few easy problems.

Day-2/: Continuing with easy problems and an introduction to a medium-level problem.

Day-3/: Focusing on medium-difficulty problems and exploring advanced techniques.

...: More daily notebooks will be added as I continue to practice.

üí° Key Concepts & Techniques
Across these daily sessions, I explore a range of topics, including:

Two-Pointer Approach: A common pattern for optimizing problems on sorted arrays.

Data Structures: Practical use of lists, dictionaries, and linked lists.

Core Algorithms: Implementations of fundamental algorithms like sorting and searching.

üöÄ How to Run the Code
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nupur-Patil/Leetcode-problems.git

Navigate to a daily folder:
cd Leetcode-problems/Day-1

Open the Jupyter Notebook to view and run the code.
